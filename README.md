# Neural Network for evaluation of differences between colors

## Overview
We've developed a Neural Network for recognition of differences between color patches in Industrial Printing. Using MATLAB Deep Learning toolbox, we've created different networks, with its own dataset, to test different cases. We've also created a MATLAB GUI, to work on the network and explore and compaire their results.

Due to the conference paper published by IEEE, we cannot share the source code, but further informations are available in our report.

## IEEE Conference Paper
IEEE published a conference-paper, written by University of Pisa, about the work we developed.\
